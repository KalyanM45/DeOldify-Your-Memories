# DeOldify your Memories

DeOldify is a Python library that uses deep learning technology, specifically transfer learning, to colorize black and white photos with incredible accuracy and detail. The library is designed to automatically colorize old photographs without requiring any user input beyond the image file. DeOldify uses a pre-trained model that was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tunes it for the specific task of colorizing black and white images. This approach allows the library to achieve state-of-the-art results while requiring fewer data and training time than training a model from scratch.

The input for DeOldify is a ```Black and white image``` file in either ```PNG``` or ```JPG``` format. The library can accept the image file either from a local file path or a URL to the image. Once the image file is provided, DeOldify processes it using its pre-trained deep learning model and outputs a colorized version of the image. The library allows for customization of the colorization process through various parameters and settings, but the default configuration produces high-quality results with minimal user input.
